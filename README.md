Note that we will be using Python 3.6+ for this course. Please make sure you have installed the correct version.
[Jupyter Installation Instructions](http://jupyter.org/install)

Alternatively, you can use software containerizations software that has Jupyter pre-installed. This method will be demonstrated later on in the course.

For those of you that are already familiar with tools such as Docker, you can pull the following container down and it will contain everything you need to run the notebooks for this course unless otherwise specified.

#### The Docker Way

`docker pull jupyter/scipy-notebook` for a python docker container with jupyter that contains most of the scietific python stack.

`docker pull jupyter/datascience-notebook` is another alternative that includes kernels for R and Julia, in case you want to explore those languages as well.
